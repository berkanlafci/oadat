Backprojection
------------------------------------------------------------

We use backprojection algorithm in this study to generate OA images from the acquired signals presented in `pyoat <https://github.com/berkanlafci/pyoat>`_. This algorithm is based on delay and sum beamforming approach. First, a mesh grid is created to represent the imaged field of view. Then, the distance between the points of the mesh grid and transducer elements are calculated based on the known locations of the array elements. Time of flight is obtained through dividing distance by the speed of sound values that are assigned based on the temperature of the imaging medium and tissue properties. The clinical and simulated data are reconstructed with speed of sound of 1510 m/s in this study as the simulations and the experiments were done at the corresponding imaging medium temperature.
